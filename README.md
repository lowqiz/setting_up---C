# setting_up (BSQ)

## Description
setting_up is an introductory algorithmic project developed in C as part of the Epitech Bootstrap Quest (BSQ).

The objective of this project is to analyze a map and identify the largest possible square composed of empty cells, then display the result by marking this square directly on the map.

This project focuses on algorithmic logic, map parsing, and precise output formatting.

This is my third C project, following my_printf and my_ls, and it reflects a progression toward more algorithm-oriented problem solving.
